TODO
====

Currently there is a lot to do:
 * help the tidy project to localize the error messages
 * translate our own messages (in the 'local' folder)
 * Try to figure out if the current design is ok, and if not
  change it. We can also add more options in how to display
  the errors/html
 * Include a link checker (locked to x levels deeper)
 * Implement the display of the document parse tree, if
  requested
