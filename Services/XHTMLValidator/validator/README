The Aborla.net Validator is released under the LGPL license.


This HTML/XHTML/XML validator is based on Tidy (http://tidy.sf.net)
and *only* works on PHP 5.

In order to use this software, you need to have PHP 5 compiled with:
 * Tidy (1st June 2004 or newer)
 * OpenSSL (to use the 'https://' wrapper)
 * iconv (for UTF-8 translations)
 * aspell 0.60.x or newer (for spell checking)
 * xdiff (optional)

Note: It's recommended the use of PHP >= 5.0.2.
Note 2: PHP 5.1.0 is required to enable spell checking

All code runs with no errors with E_ALL | E_STRICT and was tested
with PHP 5.1-dev.

This program uses the Text_Diff PEAR package (bundled).
This bundled version was modified to be fully PHP 5 compliance. This
package allows us to generate diffs when xdiff isn't avaliable,
althought Text_Diff will use it when avaliable.

The code isn't finished because tidylib itself isn't finished. The
tidylib still contains a couple of bugs and the messages aren't
still localized.
